# Multicast Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks

Multicast routing is one of the most active research area in Wireless Sensor Networks. There are many applications in which one to many dissemination is very important, e.g., in a fire handling system, the actuators need to turn on the water sprinklers on receiving a fire report.

Developed for TinyOS: an embedded, component-based operating system and platform for low-power wireless devices (e.g. http://zolertia.io).
